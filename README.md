# Bank Account Statement (Ruby)

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bank-account-statement.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/bank-account-statement)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tiredpixel/bank-account-statement-rb.png?branch=master,release)](https://travis-ci.org/tiredpixel/bank-account-statement-rb)

Bank account statement format transformation (HTML to OFX).

Bank Account Statement is a program for transforming the format of bank account
statements. For some reason, many banks don't offer online bank statements in a
readily-consumable format (this seems to be especially true in the UK). For
example, despite it being possible to view bank statements online for UK bank
*The Co-operative Bank*, statements for personal current (checking) accounts
cannot be downloaded except in HTML. Business accounts often don't fare much
better.

Bank Account Statement mitigates this problem by providing input parsers and
output generators, with a simple executable. Unlike various other similar
programs, I **am** prepared to accept pull-requests for other banks and
output formats. (Please remember to sanitise any test fixtures! Tests for new
input formats are not necessarily expected, however, because I'm concerned
about copyright.)

Run the tests, which use [MiniTest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest):

Unfortunately, many input formats have no tests committed, because I'm concerned
about copyright.
