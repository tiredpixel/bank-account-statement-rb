# Bank Account Statement (Ruby)

Bank account statement format transformation (HTML to OFX).

Bank Account Statement is a program for transforming the format of bank account
statements. For some reason, many banks don't offer online bank statements in a
readily-consumable format (this seems to be especially true in the UK). For
example, despite it being possible to view bank statements online for UK bank
*The Co-operative Bank*, statements for personal current (checking) accounts
cannot be downloaded except in HTML. Business accounts often don't fare much
better.

Bank Account Statement mitigates this problem by providing input parsers and
output generators, with a simple executable. Unlike various other similar
programs, I **am** prepared to accept tested pull-requests for other banks and
output formats. (Please remember to sanitise test fixtures!)

*Bank Account Statement is currently pre-release! It is not yet available as
a gem.*
