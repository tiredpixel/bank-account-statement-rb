# Bank Account Statement (Ruby)

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bank-account-statement.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/bank-account-statement)

Bank account statement format transformation (HTML to OFX).

Bank Account Statement is a program for transforming the format of bank account
statements. For some reason, many banks don't offer online bank statements in a
readily-consumable format (this seems to be especially true in the UK). For
example, despite it being possible to view bank statements online for UK bank
*The co-operative bank*, statements for personal current (checking) accounts
cannot be downloaded except in HTML. Business accounts often don't fare much
better.

Bank Account Statement mitigates this problem by providing input parsers and
output generators, with a simple executable. Currently, the only input formatter
is UK bank *The co-operative bank* HTML personal current account
pre-2015-03-03 (approx.). Other *The co-operative bank* input formatters are
planned. The only output formatter is *OFX (Open Financial Exchange) 2.1.1*,
which should be compatible with most financial programs. Unlike various other
similar programs, I **am** prepared to accept tested pull-requests for other
banks and output formats. (Please remember to sanitise test fixtures!)

*Bank Account Statement is currently pre-release! It is not yet available as
a gem.*
